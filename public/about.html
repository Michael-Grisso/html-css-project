        <p>You probably already figured out I'm a big baseball fan (a true Cubs fan though).  In 2021 we were blessed to take in a Seattle Mariners game at T-Mobile Park in Seattle. Our son just got out of the Army, so we went out for a visit.  Eventually we decided to take a cool helicopter ride with <a class="link-highlight" href="https://www.atomichelicopters.com" target="_blank">Atomic Helicopters</a>.  It was a blast and a new experience for me.  After the tour they took a picture of us outside the helicopter and used it on their website.</p>
        <p>If I'm not traveling, hanging with the family, or doing house projects, you will find me in from of a computer.  I've been fascinated with them since the 1990s.  It wasn't until the Covid-19 pandemic really hit in 2020 that my wife and I decided I should make a career change from Operations Manager (8 years) to Full Stack web development.</p>
        <p>It has been an interesting journey and I still have tons to learn, but I've enjoyed every minute of it.  This little practice portfolio is my way of showing you I have some expertise in HTML5 and CSS3.  I also have about a year under my belt with JavaScript.</p>
        <p>I'm currrently enrolled at Kingsland University.  It should finish up by the end of 2022, so if you're looking for someone to fill an entry level front-end position...it's a job I feel comfortable doing now.  Just click the contact button in the top-right of the page and reach out.</p>
