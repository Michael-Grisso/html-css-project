# html-css-project
Initial school project for setting up github (25pts), a profile page (75pts), and a little extra credit if you make an About me and Contact me page.

Part 1. Github Set up:

1. Make Repo
2. Have commits
3. Submit repo URL to homework grader comments section

Issues: In the beginning I had a lot of problems with the terminal in VS Code.  Eventually I had to take a Zoom call with my TA to figure it out.  Even though we didn't fix the issue on this call, it did help me come up with other reasons as to why it wasn't working.  I ended up having to pull my files out of the folder in order for it to work, then add them back in. 

Also came across an error regarding showing too many files in the changes area, which turned out to be because I pulled the folder out to the desktop.  Once this was fixed I don't believe I've had any issues since.

Part 2. Profile Page:

1. Make an HTML file
2. Link to git-hub profile (I checked the brand/logo usage and linked through GH's logo)
3. Link to Linkedin account (same thing w/the brand/logo here).
4. Create a list of "projects," that are neatly arranged and have links to their GH repo.
4a. Since we don't have many projects, we can just make some up for now (I used images from two sites I mess around with on Wordpress and a third fake website.  The baseball-website I have been learning to use Beaver Builder when I have extra time.  I created repos for all of these as well).
5. Link custom CSS file.
6. No attribute-based CSS, all class and tag based.
7. Be creative and add your own flair (I tried doing this with background images, responsive-hovering, changing link colors with various screen sizes, etc.).

Part 3. Extra Credit:

1. Make an About me page
2. Have to have a profile picture w/a small paragraph about me.
3. Must follow the same collapsing theme as the other pages.

4. Make a Contact me page
5. Same layout as other pages.
6. Have a place to write a message and send it.
7. This link will not work, but that's okay.
8. Linked bootstrap CSS to page.

Issues: My other learning curve revolved around media queries.  Now that the project is complete I have a feeling I was taking the old school, long road to RWD.  Since the last requirement was adding bootstrap css and it changed everything, I ended up removing it.  It's still in the notes showing I did it, but I didn't want to take the time trying to go through everything again after the amount of time I spent on the project as a whole.  I believe it's part of the extra credit only, so I don't think it affects my initial project grading.

If you happen to come across this and have any feedback to help me progress I'd appreciate it.
